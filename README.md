# INFSHelper
An android helper app for INFS Java students struggling with tough concepts

## Student Learning
The app includes video walkthroughs from YouTube, along with 40 topic-specific quiz questions divided into 8 sets of topics, for students to test themselves against the course content.


There are 5 random-ordered true or false questions on each quiz, and each will contribute to the total score that students have out of 40.

## App Gamification
Users can select the trophy bubble from the home screen of the app, and will see their personal scoreboard for each topic, showing where they can improve to get that total score up to 40 points. 


This total score out of 40 is also displayed on the home screen so users can see how they're tracking.

## API Integration
This app uses the following APIs (in order of appearance):
- Glide API for managing the loading screen animation
- SQLite API for holding and managing the scores for topics
- YouTube API for loading and displaying topic-relevant tutorial videos on each topic's detailed page.
